# VIM ReasonML Syntax Plugin

This plugin provides two things:

1.  ReasonML file-type detection.
1.  ReasonML syntax highlighting definitions.

## Acknowledgments

This syntax file is a fork of [vim-reasonml](https://github.com/jordwalke/vim-reasonml) by Jordan W., but was extensively modified to allow more accurate, and IMO - robust, highlighting of the language elements thereby providing easier scanning of source code.
