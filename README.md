# VIM ReasonML Syntax Plugin

This plugin provides two things:

1.  ReasonML file-type detection.
1.  ReasonML syntax highlighting definitions.

## Acknowledgments

Roughly half of the syntax file is based on the vim-rust plugin, by way of some addition reason plugins, and most recently, the syntax file provided by Jordan W. in [vim-reasonml](https://github.com/jordwalke/vim-reasonml).
The other half was written from scratch to allow more accurate, and IMO - robust, highlighting of the language.
